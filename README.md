Mahjong4RL is a project that recreates the game of Japanese Mahjong and use deep reinforcement learning to play it.

[Japanese Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Mahjong), or Riichi Mahjong, is a variation of mahjong. While the basic rules to the game are retained, the variation emphasizes on player's menzenchin and features a unique set of rules such as riichi and doras.

We aim to create a game system of Japanese Mahjong from scratch. We will be implementing [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13590) afterwards.
